# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed
> the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a
> new
> application" step, before proceeding.


To install necessary dependencies, run

```bash
npm install
```

For iOS, you also need to run
```bash
cd ios
pod install
```
Issuing `pod install` will generate a XCode workspace where you can run the example in an emulator.

# Development modules
To be able to run unreleased modules, you need to checkout the module repo and update the dependency to be file based. 
First, create the package:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/curityio/react-native-haapi-module.git
cd react-native-haapi-module
npm pack
```

This should create a `.tgz` file.

Then we can update the depdencies.

```bash
npm uninstall @curity/react-native-haapi-module
npm install <path-to-file>.tgz --save
```

Alternatively, we can use the repo directly to be able to easily change the source code without having to pack the
module for each change.

```bash
npm uninstall @curity/react-native-haapi-module
npm install <path-to-repo> --save
```


## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the
following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_
shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

# Curity Identity Server configuration

To configure clients needed for this example to run, there's config specs for [android](config/setup-android-no-attestation-validation.xml) and [ios](config/setup-ios-no-attestation-validation.xml) that can be imported using the admin UI in `Changes -> Run Config Spec`. Running a spec will prompt you for basic information needed to create the client. Some default values will be added, which for development purposes should not need to be changed. Redirect URI for the clients will configured as `app:start`.

## Configure passkey authentication
See [Mobile Logins Using Passkeys](https://curity.io/resources/learn/mobile-logins-using-native-passkeys/) article in the Curity resource library for setting up the authenticator and clients using the admin UI.
For convenience, clients can be setup using [android](config/setup-android-no-attestation-validation-passkeys.xml) or [ios](config/setup-ios-no-attestation-validation-passkeys.xml) config specs. Associated domains has to be added to the iOS workspace manually.

### Android signing certificate
Android needs to have the fingerprint of the signing certificate configured when passkeys are enabled. To find your fingerprint, go to `android/` folder in a terminal and issue:
```bash
./gradlew signingReport
```
Locate the SHA256 fingerprint in the report and configure it using the config spec.
